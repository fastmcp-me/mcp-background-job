  - [ ] output tool - get full job output
  - [ ] tail tool - get recent output lines

- [ ] Implement interactive tools
  - [ ] execute tool - start new background job
  - [ ] interact tool - send input to job
  - [ ] kill tool - terminate job

## Phase 6: Error Handling & Validation

- [ ] Custom exception classes
  - [ ] JobNotFoundError
  - [ ] JobAlreadyTerminatedError

  - [ ] Parameter bounds checking

- [ ] Error response formatting
  - [ ] Consistent error messages
  - [ ] Proper HTTP status codes for MCP errors

## Phase 7: Security & Resource Management

- [ ] Command security
  - [ ] Command allowlist/blocklist implementation
  - [ ] Shell injection prevention
  - [ ] Path traversal protection

- [ ] Resource limits
  - [ ] Maximum concurrent jobs enforcement
  - [ ] Memory usage monitoring
  - [ ] Process timeout handling

- [ ] Cleanup mechanisms
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup of old jobs
  - [ ] Resource leak prevention
  - [ ] Graceful shutdown handling

## Phase 8: Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Unit test setup
  - [ ] Test fixtures for jobs and processes
  - [ ] Mock subprocess for isolated testing
  - [ ] Test utilities and helpers

- [ ] Core functionality tests

  - [ ] Data model validation tests

- [ ] MCP tool integration tests
  - [ ] Tool execution tests
  - [ ] Error handling tests
  - [ ] Input/output validation tests

## Phase 9: Integration Testing

- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
  - [ ] Execute → status → output → kill workflow
  - [ ] Execute → interact → output workflow
  - [ ] Concurrent job handling tests

- [ ] Long-running process tests
  - [ ] Jobs that run for extended periods
  - [ ] Memory usage over time
  - [ ] Output buffering under load

- [ ] Edge case testing
  - [ ] Invalid job IDs
  - [ ] Already terminated processes
  - [ ] Resource exhaustion scenarios

## Phase 10: Documentation & Examples
